# Tanks Game

3D Tanks Game is a 2 player shooter game using one keyboard that uses simple game mechanics, integrating world and screen space UI, as well as game architecture and audio mixing...

It was implemented following [Tanks Tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/tanks-tutorial) on Unity Learn Platform.

With this project, I've implemented a proper game Menu, more game modes, a bot-controlled tank and the most important one, PlayerPreference to set player's name and profile pic, multiplayer with Photon PUN with chat
